So walking up and down these gravestones I know that I am reading it wrong. It is not "gone to be in the rest of God" as in relaxation, leisure, and ease. It is gone to be in the REST of God. Because there is more to Him. So much more.</p>

                                Where do they come from?
                                the inner mind?
                                the subconscious?
                                Or the universe?
                                Even those writing may not know
                                I don’t
                                The words come
                                Or they don’t
                                They pull themselves from inside me
                                Trying to get free
                                Trying to release themselves
                                They sometimes tug
                                Or they yank
                                It depends on what they have to say
                                Or what I need to say
                                There are days where I want them to come
                                And others that they force themselves from me
                                I want to be profound
                                But mostly gibberish comes forth
                                These poems are a journal
                                In and of themselves
                                They express how I feel
                                Or what needs to be said
                                In a way
                                Only poems can show
                                I don’t know what others would think
                                When they saw my ramblings
                                Would you think me crazy
                                Or just a person
                                Who can’t always express their feelings
                                Expect through the words that come through poems</p>

                            How many have stared into a moonless night and seen it's angel kissed face.
                            How many have asked those heavens their deepest questions or dreamed upon a shooting star.
                            It is powerful to know that the creator of that great shimmering expanse also created you.
                            He has sent messages to those of ancient days and will answer the heartaches and prayers of the modern wanderers of the night.
